# RPGMe-Current-
Built from the ground up, a second try at a bot used to run RPG games in a GroupMe (and perhaps other chat platforms in the future) chat built in a manner that makes it easy for anyone to change a few resource files to create their own chat RPG the way they see fit.

A real README should be coming in the near future, along with WIP user guide and example player guide.
